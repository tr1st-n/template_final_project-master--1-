## Project Description

This will be a simple game of Blackjack against a CPU. The player and CPU will be dealt with 2 cards, both of your cards being shown and only one of the CPU's cards being shown. You can choose to either stand or hit. If you hit and go over you will be presented with a gameover screen. If you hit and don't go over and the CPU goes over then you will be met with a winning screen. You will also be automatically met with a winning screen if both you and the CPU stand and you have a higher value of cards or if you hit 21.
